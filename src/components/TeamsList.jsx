/**
 * Given a list of teams, we need to expose the teams in different ways:
 * - Criteria 1: depending on the score, order the list from highest to lowest.
 * - Criteria 2: depending on the score, order the list from lowest to highest.
 * - Criteria 3: depending on the player's quantity, show ONLY the teams that has more than 3 players.
 *
 * What you need to implement is:
 * - 3 buttons. Each of them need to execute a criteria.
 * - The list of teams should be updated dynamically depending on the selected filter.
 * - Each team item should display: Team Name / Playerâ€™s quantity / Total Score of each team.
